# C# Authentication via PHP API

This Authentication Client is a straightforward C# console application used to interact with an authentication API. It's designed to bypass platform and programming language restrictions, allowing users to register and login via the console.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5.0 or higher
- MySQL Server

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. In `Program.cs`, replace `"http://your-api-url"` with your API's URL.

### Database Setup

Run the following SQL command on your MySQL server to set up the necessary database and table:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `user_db`;

USE `user_db`;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL, -- This should be a hashed value, not plaintext
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `username` (`username`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

This will create a database named `user_db` and a table named `users` with columns for `id`, `username`, and `password`.

Ensure your API is configured to use this database and table.
